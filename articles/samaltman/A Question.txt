I have a question for all the people that use their iPhone
or Android to complain on Twitter, Facebook, or reddit about the lack of
innovation… 
Or message their friends on WhatsApp or Snapchat about how
Silicon Valley only builds toys for rich people in between looking at photos
from their family across the world in Dropbox and listening to almost any song
they want on Spotify while in an Uber to their Airbnb…
What were you doing 10 years ago?
I think it’s remarkable how much of what people do and use
today didn’t exist 10 years ago.  And I
hope that 10 years from now, we’re using things that today seem unimaginably
fantastic. 
And while I’d like to see us turn up the pace on innovation
in the world of atoms, I hope we keep up the current blistering progress in the
world of bits.   I’ve really enjoyed
working with some of the energy and biotech companies we’ve funded at YC and
hope we see a lot more companies like SpaceX and Tesla get created.
There are some things technological innovation alone won’t
help with and that we need to address in other ways—for example, I think
massive wealth inequality is likely to be the biggest social problem of our
time—but it seems to stretch credulity to claim that we have a lack of
innovation.
I’m always in awe of the remarkable technological progress
we make decade over decade.  I think it’s
important to try not to lose your sense of wonder about this.

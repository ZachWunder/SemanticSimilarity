The 2016 US Presidential election feels like the most important one so far in my lifetime.  No one able to vote in the US should be sitting this one out—we have a major choice to make.With some friends, I helped start VotePlz to make it easier for young people to participate—technology has moved forward but registration has not (for example, young people generally don’t have printers or stamps, and many states still don’t have online registration).A lot of people are working hard to get their friends registered to vote, and we wanted to do something for them. So today, we’re announcing a VotePlz sweepstakes with a million dollars in prizes.Some of the prizes are $50,000 in student loan payoffs or scholarship.After you check your registration, you get a referral link. For each person you get to check their registration, you’ll get one entry into the sweepstakes (up to 25).You can see how you’re doing here and how your school is doing here.Also we just launched an iOS app that lets you register just by taking a photo of your Driver’s License, and easily share VotePlz with your contacts.
We need your help.  Please check your registration (https://plz.vote) and share this with your friends and family!

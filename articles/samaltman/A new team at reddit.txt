Last week, Yishan Wong resigned from reddit.
The reason was a disagreement
with the board about a new office (location and amount of money to spend on a
lease).  To be clear, though, we didn’t ask or suggest that he resign—he
decided to when we didn’t approve the new office plan.
We wish him the best and we’re thankful for the work he’s done
to grow reddit more than 5x.
I am delighted to announce the new team we have in place. 
Ellen Pao will be stepping up to be interim CEO.  Because of her combination
of vision, execution, and leadership, I expect that she’ll do an incredible
job.
Alexis Ohanian, who cofounded reddit nine and a half years ago,
is returning as full-time executive chairman (he will transition to a part-time
partner role at Y Combinator).  He will be responsible for marketing, communications, strategy, and
community.
There is a long history of founders returning to companies and
doing great things.  Alexis probably knows the reddit community better
than anyone else on the planet.  He had the original product vision for
the company and I’m excited he’ll get to finish the job.  Founders are
able to set the vision for their companies with an authority no one else can.
Dan McComas will
become SVP Product.  Dan founded redditgifts, where in addition to
building a great product he built a great culture, and has already been an
integral part of the reddit team—I look forward to seeing him impact the
company more broadly.
Although
my 8 days as the CEO of reddit have been sort of fun, I am happy they are
coming to a close and I am sure the new team will do a far better job and take
reddit to great heights.  It’s interesting to note that during my very
brief tenure, reddit added more users than Hacker News has in total.

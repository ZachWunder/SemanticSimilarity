I’m delighted to finally be investing in Asana, which I’ve
wanted to do for a long time.
One of the things I’ve learned about companies is that 1) clear
tasks and goals, 2) clearly communicated, and 3) with clear and frequent
measurement are very important to success. 
Most companies fail at all 3 of these, and they become more important as
companies get bigger.  Asana is the best way to excel in these 3 areas.
“You make what you measure” is really true, and most companies
don’t measure well at all.  I spend a lot
of time talking to people who work at startups, and most employees feel like
they don’t have a good sense of what specifically the company needs to get done
and how all the tasks are going.  Better
work tracking leads to better collaboration and better decision-making.
Another thing I’ve learned investing in startups is how
important it is to have some users that really love a product (instead of
liking it pretty much).  Asana has the
level of product love that all great companies have in common.  As a small example, their recurring revenue
has been incredibly sticky and more than doubled every year.
Asana is the kind of lever that could someday massively increase
the productivity of hundreds of millions of people around the world.  There’s not only an opportunity for Asana to
be a huge company, but also for Asana to materially increase the output for the
planet—somewhat amazingly, software has not yet eaten this important part of
the world. 
Finally, Asana has an incredible team that, as far as I can tell
as an outsider, really believes in the mission and loves the work environment
(the Glassdoor reviews, something I check before every late-stage investment,
are among the best I’ve ever seen). 
These
are all the ingredients that go into the development of an incredibly impactful
and valuable company.  I’m very happy to
be along for the ride.

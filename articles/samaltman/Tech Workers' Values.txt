For good and bad, technology has become a central force in all
our lives.
As members of the community, we're interested in ways in which
tech companies can use their collective power to protect privacy, rule of law,
freedom of expression, and other fundamental American rights.  
We’d also like to discuss how tech companies can heal the divide
in our country. We believe that tech companies can create a better economic
future for all Americans by spreading high-paying technology jobs around the
country and other measures. We also
believe tech companies have an opportunity and an obligation to reduce the
polarization we've helped create.
Tech companies are very receptive to their employees'
influence. We believe that employees should come together and clearly
define the values and policies they'd like to see their companies uphold. A tech union isn't the
perfect metaphor for this, but it's not far off.
We are planning to hold a meeting on the evening of April 9th in the Bay Area. Please sign up here or message us at 415 569-2751 on Signal if you'd like to come.
We're going try to keep this first group smaller than 50
people so that everyone can actually participate. If more people than that
want to attend, we'll try to select a diverse group of people from a large set
of companies. If this event seems to go well, we expect to host similar
meetings in the future.

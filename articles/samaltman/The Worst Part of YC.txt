We are going to send out YC summer 2014 interview decisions (both yes and no) before 10 pm PDT tonight.The worst part of our job at YC is rejecting companies.  It leaves me feeling down for many days after
our application process.  I experienced
plenty of rejection from investors while running my own startup, and I remember
well how bad it is.  Starting a startup
is such a hard thing that we wish we could help everyone doing so.
Some day, we hope to be able to fund almost all the good
startups.  In the meantime, we still have
capacity constraints as we figure out how to scale, and that means we’re stuck saying
no to potentially good companies.
The best startups often look bad at this stage, and we make
mistakes.  We could easily miss something
great.  If you’re working on something
that users love, you like working on it, and you have a plan for how to build a
business around it, then please don’t let us deter you.  (It's sometimes useful to ask friends for an outside perspective on how you're doing.)
Although we had nearly 20% more applications than a year
ago, it was really striking how much higher the average quality of applications
was for this batch compared to any previous batch.  Most of the partners independently mentioned
this to me.
Anyway, to everyone we’re unable to fund: Best of luck, and
don’t give up.  We love to see founders
and companies reapply—companies that look bad now can look great with 6 months
of progress.

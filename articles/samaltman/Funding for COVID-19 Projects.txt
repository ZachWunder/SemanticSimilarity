I’m trying to fund startups/projects helping with COVID-19, because it’s basically the one thing I know how to do that can help.  I think we will soon have enough testing capacity, so now I’d like to start funding more startups working on:
Producing a lot of ventilators or masks/gowns very quickly.  This will require a lot of repurposing and creativity but thankfully is an engineering problem not a scientific ones.
Screening existing drugs for effectiveness.
Novel approaches to vaccines (i.e., not doing what the big pharma companies are already doing).
Novel therapeutics that the big pharma companies are unlikely to work on.
We tried this public spreadsheet but it didn't work that well; please email me instead.Also, if anyone knows of a contract research company that can run a viral challenge against SARS-CoV-2 in a humanized ACE2 animal model, that would help a startup I’m working with.  Please reach out!And of course, I think the best thing to do is still to get people to stay home.
